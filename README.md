# zabbix-gammu-smsd

send sms from zabbix server to phone number in case of events.

receive sms from phone number and execute appropriate script based on sms text.

All message sending & receiving is performed by <a href="https://wammu.eu/docs/manual/smsd/">gammu-smsd</a>.

# Prerequisites
1- You need a GSM modem with working SIM card connected to zabbix server. I personally use Wavecom

2- Install gammu & gammu-smsd from repo or from source. I personally instelled latest version (1.38.0) from source code with following commands:
<pre>
mkdir src
cd src
sudo yum group install 'Development Tools'
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.7/cmake-3.7.1.tar.gz
tar zxvf cmake-3.7.1.tar.gz
cd cmake-3.7.1
./bootstrap --prefix=/usr
gmake
sudo gmake install
export CMAKE_ROOT=/usr/share/cmake-3.7
cd ..
wget https://dl.cihar.com/gammu/releases/gammu-1.38.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf gammu-1.38.0.tar.gz 
cd gammu-1.38.0
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install
</pre>

3- config gammu and make sure gammu detects your GSM Modem
<pre>
// is your OS detects your modem?
#dmesg | grep ttyUSB
usb 1-2: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
// my modem is connected to ttyUSB0
#gammu-config
// generated by gammu-config
#cat ~/.gammurc
[gammu]
port = /dev/ttyUSB0
model = 
connection = at115200
synchronizetime = yes
logfile = 
logformat = nothing
use_locking = 
gammuloc = 

//send test message with gammu:
#echo "hello" | gammu --sendsms TEXT "+98XXXXXXXXXXX"
</pre>

4- TO DO..
